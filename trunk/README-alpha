This is the libumem package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or subversion version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

	This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If
you are taking source from subversion, you will need to have libtool, automake,
and autoconf installed to help contribute. See the chapter `Building' for the
detailed instructions. The script autogen.sh is provided to help autoconfigure
libumem from the cvs src.  After you run autogen.sh, there should be a file
'INSTALL' with (generic) installation instructions. Package-specific
installation instructions are set forth in the file README.

	Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate or
incomplete. The subversion history is the authoritative documentation of all
recent changes.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the subversion repository:

To checkout the source tree from subversion issue the following command:

  svn co https://labs.omniti.com/portableumem/trunk portable-umem

* Building

    In order to build this you will first need to have right versions
of autotools and some auxiliary GNU programs. At the time of this
writing these are: 

  Package   Version (>=)
  ========  ============
  automake  1.4
  autoconf  2.50
  libtool   1.5.0
  
    To prepare the package for building run autogen.sh. Then run
./configure with the desired options (See INSTALL and README for the
detailed instructions). Finally, run make. Notice that the first make
of the package should be made in the source directory. Subsequent
makes can use build directory different from the source one.
