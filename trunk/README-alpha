This is the libumem package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or CVS version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

    This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use
yet. If you are taking source from CVS, you will need to have libtool,
automake, and autoconf installed to help contribute. See the chapter
`Building' for the detailed instructions. The script autogen.sh is
provided to help autoconfigure libumem from the cvs src.  After you
run autogen.sh, there should be a file 'INSTALL' with (generic)
installation instructions. Package-specific installation instructions
are set forth in the file README.

    Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete. The CVS history is the authoritative documentation of
all recent changes.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following command:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@umem.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/umem co \
    -P umem

    This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact the mailing list.

* Building

    In order to build this you will first need to have right versions
of autotools and some auxiliary GNU programs. At the time of this
writing these are: 

  Package   Version (>=)
  ========  ============
  automake  1.4
  autoconf  2.50
  libtool   1.5.0
  
    To prepare the package for building run autogen.sh. Then run
./configure with the desired options (See INSTALL and README for the
detailed instructions). Finally, run make. Notice that the first make
of the package should be made in the source directory. Subsequent
makes can use build directory different from the source one.
